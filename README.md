## 📘 Multimodel Math Mentor – AI-Driven Mathematical Problem Solver

Math Mentor is a modular, AI-assisted mathematical problem-solving web application built using Python and Streamlit. It intelligently interprets natural-language math queries, routes them to domain-specific solvers, and returns step-by-step explanations with accurate final results.

### Key Highlights

- ***Multi-domain support:*** Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Linear Algebra

- ***Natural language understanding:*** Converts user input into symbolic expressions

- ***Explainable solutions:*** Displays intermediate reasoning, not just final answers

- ***Scalable architecture:*** Topic-based routing enables easy extension to new domains

- ***Clean UI:*** Interactive Streamlit interface for real-time problem solving

## System Design

- ***Input parsing:*** Regex + rule-based NLP for math expression extraction

- ***Computation engine:*** SymPy for symbolic solving and evaluation

- ***Routing logic:*** Dynamic solver selection based on detected topic

- ***Output layer:*** Structured steps + final answer formatting

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- SymPy
- Regex / NLP-based parsing

## Why This Project Matters

Math Mentor demonstrates strong skills in problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, symbolic computation, and modular backend design. It reflects the ability to build production-ready, explainable AI tools with a focus on user experience and scalability.
